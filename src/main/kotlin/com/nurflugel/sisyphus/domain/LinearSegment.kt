/** A LinearSegment is part of a Shape - think of one side of a rectangle.  It is one intrinsic, STRAIGHT stroke which can
 * (and must sometimes) be drawn differently than it is.
 *
 * For example, a line (represented by two points), must be drawn as a series of arcs between the points, since
 * Sisyphus is a rho/theta system.  Makes drawing circles REALLY easy, but makes lines much harder.
 *
 * Any shape can be represented by a number of linear segments.  When it comes time
 * to draw, we take each segment, and decompose it into a list of sub-segments.  A sub-segment is still a segment, but
 * but the numberOfSubSegments parameter is always 1.  Make enough sub-segments, and the series of arcs drawn will approximate the straight linear segment.
 *
 * In general, the greater the delta theta (like a flat line), then the greater number of sub-segments are needed
 * to draw it properly.
 *
 * In contrast, a circle/arc has fixed rho, and needs NO sub-segments in this system
 *
